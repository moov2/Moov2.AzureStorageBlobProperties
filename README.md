# Microsoft Azure Storage Blob Properties

Module for [Orchard CMS](http://orchardproject.net) that gives the ability to define properties in files that are uploaded to Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. Out of the box Orchard supplies modules that handle uploading files to blob storage on Azure, however there is currently no way to define [properties on the blob](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.windowsazure.storage.blob.blobproperties.aspx), e.g. cache control. This module supresses `AzureBlobStorageProvider` and handles setting properties configured in the root `Web.config` when files are uploaded.
